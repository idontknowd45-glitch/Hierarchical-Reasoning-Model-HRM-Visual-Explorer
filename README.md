# Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) Visual Explorer
Overview
The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) Visual Explorer is an interactive platform that helps users understand how the HRM — a biologically inspired AI reasoning architecture — functions. It bridges neuroscience and machine reasoning by explaining how HRM uses two interdependent modules:

A Slow (High-Level) module for abstract planning
A Fast (Low-Level) module for rapid execution
The app showcases these concepts visually and interactively, making advanced AI reasoning ideas accessible to everyone.

Key Features

Introductory Learning Section: Simple explanations and visuals explaining HRM principles and its human-brain inspiration.
Architecture Visualizer: Dynamic diagrams displaying fast/slow module interactions, cross-frequency coupling, and hierarchical processing concepts.
Benchmark Explorer: Interactive charts demonstrating HRM’s performance on complex reasoning benchmarks (ARC tasks, Sudoku puzzles, and maze pathfinding).
Hands-on Demos: Mini simulations where users can observe HRM’s “thought process” in solving logic-based tasks.
Technical Details

Frontend: React + TypeScript with TailwindCSS for modern, responsive visuals
Backend: Motoko actor on the Internet Computer providing data about architectural insights and benchmark results
Storage & Hosting: Deployed on the Internet Computer network
