# Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) Visual Explorer

## Overview
An educational web application showcasing the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), an AI architecture inspired by hierarchical processing in the human brain. The application provides an interactive, beginner-friendly exploration of HRM's architecture, performance benchmarks, and reasoning capabilities with engaging visuals and simplified explanations.

## Core Features

### Introductory Section
- Clear, simple explanation of what HRM is and why it matters
- Beginner-friendly description of how HRM is inspired by human brain processing
- Visual diagram showing the basic concept of "slow" (planning) and "fast" (execution) modules
- Short animation demonstrating how slow and fast modules interact and communicate
- Engaging hook that connects AI concepts to everyday human thinking

### Enhanced Architecture Visualization
- Interactive diagram showing HRM's high-level and low-level recurrent modules
- Simplified, beginner-level explanations with tooltips and hover popups for key concepts:
  - Cross Frequency Coupling (with analogy like "manager coordinating with employees")
  - Meta-representation (explained as "thinking about thinking")
  - Hierarchical Processing (described as "layers of decision-making")
- Visual representation of the hierarchical processing structure
- "How it Works" animation cycling through: input → planning (slow) → execution (fast) → solution

### Upgraded Benchmark Showcase
- User-friendly comparison charts with accessible language instead of raw technical numbers
- Performance descriptions like "HRM performs 15% better than traditional models on logic puzzles"
- Visual emphasis on HRM's advantages across different tasks:
  - ARC-1 and ARC-2 (pattern recognition challenges)
  - Sudoku Extreme (logic puzzle solving)
  - Maze Hard (pathfinding problems)
- Horizontal bar or column charts with clear visual comparisons
- Friendly explanations of what each benchmark measures

### Interactive Learning Panel
- Clear instructions on how to use the Sudoku and Maze demonstrations
- "Watch how it thinks" toggle feature to slow down the reasoning process
- Step-by-step visual breakdown of HRM's problem-solving approach
- Interactive panels showing reasoning capabilities with educational context
- Beginner-friendly explanations of each step in the problem-solving process

### Enhanced User Interface
- Bright neural-network-inspired color themes with blue-violet gradients
- Animated neural connections and smooth transitions throughout
- Professional yet approachable design suitable for educational purposes
- Dark/light mode toggle functionality
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- Polished animations and visual effects for engaging user experience

### Footer Summary Section
- "In Plain Terms" summary explaining HRM's purpose in accessible language
- Clear statement: "A new model inspired by human reasoning that learns efficiently and solves complex problems — bridging neuroscience and AI"
- Simple takeaway messages for visitors to understand HRM's significance

## Technical Requirements
- All content and interactions are frontend-only
- No backend data storage required
- Static content presentation with rich interactive elements
